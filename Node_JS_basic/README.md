# NodeJS Basics

## Description

This project provides a foundational understanding of NodeJS. From executing basic JavaScript using NodeJS, to working with modules, reading files, creating HTTP servers, and leveraging Express for route handling.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Run JavaScript using NodeJS
- Use NodeJS modules
- Read files using NodeJS
- Access command line arguments and the environment using `process`
- Create HTTP servers using NodeJS and ExpressJS
- Create advanced routes with ExpressJS
- Use ES6 with NodeJS through Babel-node
- Speed up development using Nodemon

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using node (version 12.x.x)
- Files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
- Use the `.js` extension for your code
- Tests will be executed using Jest: `npm run test`
- Linting will be checked using ESLint
- Ensure all tests and lints pass: `npm run full-test`
- Functions/classes should be exported as: `module.exports = myFunction;`

## Resources

- [Node JS getting started](#)
- [Process API doc](#)
- [Child process](#)
- [Express getting started](#)
- [Mocha documentation](#)
- [Nodemon documentation](#)

## Files Provided

- `database.csv`
- `package.json`
- `babel.config.js`
- `.eslintrc.js`

**Note:** Don't forget to run `$ npm install` after cloning the repository to install necessary node packages.

## Tasks

### 1 Executing Basic JavaScript with Node JS: Create a function that displays a message.

### 2 Using Process stdin: Interact with users via command line, capturing and responding to their input.

### 3 Reading a File Synchronously with Node JS: Synchronously read a database file and display the number of students per field.

### 4 Reading a File Asynchronously with Node JS: Similar to Task 3, but asynchronously.

### 5 Create a Small HTTP Server Using Node's HTTP Module: Develop an HTTP server that responds with "Hello Holberton School!" for any endpoint.

### 6 Create a More Complex HTTP Server Using Node's HTTP Module: Expand the server to differentiate between the root path and the "/students" path.

### 7 Create a Small HTTP Server Using Express: Create a similar HTTP server, but this time using the Express framework.

### 8 Create a More Complex HTTP Server Using Express: Enhance the Express server with more routing options.

### 9 Organize a Complex HTTP Server Using Express: Structure a server with controllers, routes, and utilities. Use babel-node for ES6 features.
